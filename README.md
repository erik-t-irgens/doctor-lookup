# _DOCTOR LOOKUP_

#### _Takes user input, either in the form of Doctor's name or user symptom, and provides a list of relevant search results in the form of doctors._

#### By _**Erik Irgens**_

## Description

_Users will be prompted to input a doctor's name (if they know it), a symptom they have, or both. User should then receive a list (within a range between 1 and 10 - also specified by the user), in an order specified by the user, of doctors that meet the criteria. Pictures will display if provided, including placeholders if the doctor has provided no picture. Email, address, bio, phone number, and availability will also be displayed if the information is available._
